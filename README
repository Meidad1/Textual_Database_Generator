-------------------------
This is a tool which receives urls (right now only from the Namibian New Era website) of articles written
in Khoekhoe and urls for their original equivalents in English, and generates text files which contain the textual
content of each article and its English equivalent. It generates xlsx tables as well, containing the meta data and the
content itself.
__________________________

INPUT:
Make sure the following files are in the main folder of the project (the same folder as main.py):
1. A txt file which contains the KK articles urls. Each line in the file should contains one url.
2. A txt file which contains the English articles urls. Each line in the file should contains one url
REMARK: the urls in both files must correspond with each other and be in the same order. For example, the first url
in the KK urls file must be the translation of the article in the first url in the English urls file.

EXECUTION:
Open the your CMD on the folder of the code files, or you can also create a pycharm (or other IDE) project.
Run the command: python3 <KK/LUG URLs file path> <ENG URLs file path> <KK / LUG>

OUTPUT:
In the same folder of the project you will find two output folders:
1. output_tables, which contains a table of the meta data of the articles and another table with the content of the articles.
2. output_txt, which contains a text file for each article. Each text file contains both the Khoekhoe and its English equivalent.
Each output text file is in the following format:
    Article's ID
    KK title
    Date (of the translation to a KK article)
    Author
    URL
    BODY OF THE ARTICLE (in KK)
    -------------------
    English title
    Date
    Author
    URL
    BODY OF THE ARTICLE (in English)
